# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Running Locally on Your PC

You can run this application on your local machine (like a Windows PC) for development and testing. You don't need to convert it to a desktop application. Here's how:

### Prerequisites

1.  **Install Node.js**: If you don't have it installed, download and install the "LTS" (Long Term Support) version of Node.js from the official website: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
    *   Node.js includes `npm` (Node Package Manager), which you'll need to install the project's dependencies.

### Steps to Run

1.  **Open a Terminal**: Open a command prompt, PowerShell, or any other terminal on your Windows PC.
2.  **Navigate to Project Directory**: Use the `cd` command to go to the folder where your project files are saved.
3.  **Install Dependencies**: Run the following command. This will download and install all the necessary packages listed in your `package.json` file. You only need to do this once.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Start the Development Server**: Run this command to start the application.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
5.  **View Your App**: Open your web browser and go to the address shown in the terminal, which is usually `http://localhost:9002`.

Your application is now running locally! Any changes you save to the code will automatically be reflected in your browser.
